Setup in IntelliJ requires configuring a venv for Python.  Make sure to then do the rest in the IntelliJ terminal to
take advantage of the venv.

Install the following pre-reqs first:

`pip install openai==1.13.3 python-dotenv`

To run the python test script, run the following:

`python test-openai-model.py`
